# Advanced-Segmented-Neural-Style-Transfer-for-Video-Art-Enhancement
This project improves Neural Style Transfer (NST) for video by using segmentation and a temporal loss function to apply different artistic styles to distinct areas in each frame. It ensures smooth transitions across frames, creating visually appealing, coherent stylized videos using deep learning and CNNs.
